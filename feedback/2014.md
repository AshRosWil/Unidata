# 2014 Feedback	and Comments	

## Julien Comments

- Allot 2 hours for conda
- Allot 2 hours for git
- git and conda sections should be first on the schedule because we use those technologies heavily during the workshop
- The goal of the git section is that they should be able to sync and commit to their fork
- Have pre-canned git exercises and/or pre-canned demos
- Revive pandas notebook as it showcases NCSS TDS capability. Rich demoed this during his talk.
- Consider having sections on xray, iris, biggus, cf-python
