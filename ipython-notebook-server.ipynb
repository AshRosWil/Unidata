      "## Creating the Notebook Server\n",
      "\n",
      "Creating the notebook server is performed in steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Create a profile that defines the notebook server.\n",
      "2. Create a certificate and password to use with the server.\n",
      "3. Edit the profile and specify security settings:\n",
      "    * Access Permissions\n",
      "    * Port Number\n",
      "    * Password hash\n",

      "    $ ipython profile create nbserver\n",
      "    \n",
      "On a linux/unix machine, this will create the ~/.ipython/profile_nbserver directory. In this directory, amongst all the files created by ipython, will be the **ipython_notebook_config.py** file.  This is the file we will be working in for the configuration steps of this process.\n",

      "### Caveats regarding the use of a self-signed certificate\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that when using a self-signed certificate, your browser may complain that the sight is not necessarily valid.  Because you created the certificate, it is safe to allow an exception for this server/certificate.  If it is possible to instead use a valid signed certificate in place of a self-signed certificate, this is preferable.\n",
