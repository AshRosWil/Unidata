      "# Remote iPython Notebooks\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "The focus of this talk is on an advanced-usage case for iPython notebook.  As we have seen, using iPython notebook locally is a very straight-forward process. Sometimes, it is advantageous to set up an iPython notebook for use by multiple people.  This requires installing and configuring iPython notebook on a centralized server of some sort. I will also briefly discuss options for hosting a network-accessable iPython notebook.\n",

      "## Creating the Notebook Server\n",
      "\n",
      "Creating the notebook server is performed in steps.  These are adapted from official instructions provided at the [Official iPython Website][ipython-web].\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Create a profile that defines the notebook server.\n",
      "2. Create a certificate and password to use with the server.\n",
      "3. Edit the profile and specify security settings:\n",
      "    * Access Permissions\n",
      "    * Port Number\n",
      "    * Password hash\n",

      "\n",
      "Creating the profile for the server allows you to manage multiple iPython notebook sets on your local machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "    `$ ipython profile create nbserver`\n",
      "    \n",
      "On a linux/unix machine, this will create the ~/.ipython/profile_nbserver directory. In this directory, amongst all the files created by ipython, will be the **ipython_notebook_config.py** file.  This is the file we will be working in for the configuration steps of this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Creating a self-signed certificate file, if necessary\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless you have an institutional security certificate, you will need to create a self-signed certificate file for use with your server.  This will allow secure access.\n",

      "### Caveats regarding the use of a self-signed certificate\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that when using a self-signed certificate, your browser may complain that the sight is not necessarily valid.  Because you created the certificate, it is safe to allow an exception for this server/certificate.  If it is possible to instead use a valid signed certificate in place of a self-signed certificate, this is preferable.\n",
