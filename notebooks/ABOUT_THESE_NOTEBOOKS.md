# Suggestions for exploring the notebook collection

Each notebook is a self-contained document, and they can be explored in any order.  But their real power is as a set of resources you can adjust and adapt. Once you understand them, you can learn to mix-and-match the examples demonstrated here to construct your own notebooks. 

A few suggestions for possible user approaches are offered here. A complete listing can be found at the bottom. 

--------------
## Beginner's approach

A good place to start is on Jupyter itself, from the **Jupyter_Notebooks** folder. 
  - Jupyter's own Help menu is excellent. Be sure to notice its features.
  - For Python code, notice the power of 
    - _tab_ key for autocomplete suggestions after a period . showing an object's _attributes and methods_
    - _shift + tab_ keys for documentation on any object whose name the cursor is placed within

**Primer** notebooks are oriented to beginners.

**Pythonic_Data_Analysis** and **Time_Series_Analysis** are good early lessons on code-to-figures workflow. 

**Bonus/What to do when things go wrong.ipynb** can help users throughout their journey. 

For meteorology work, get oriented with **Metpy_Introduction/Introduction to MetPy.ipynb**
