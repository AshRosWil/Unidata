# Unidata's Python Training Workshop

This workshop teaches the use of python in the atmospheric and oceanic sciences,
with a particular emphasis on using Unidata's
[other technologies](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/) through Python.

## Getting started
See the [installation instructions](installation.html) for information on how
to set up a Python environment with the appropriate packages. You can also get
a temporary environment from
[mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org/repo/Unidata/unidata-python-workshop) which
will let you test out the Python notebooks without downloading anything to your
local system.

You can also just view the notebooks on
[NBViewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Unidata/unidata-python-workshop/tree/master/notebooks/)
to get a feel for what's in the workshop.
