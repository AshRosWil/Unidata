# netCDF File Exploration with Python and NumPy
- netcdf4-python
- Interactively Exploring a netCDF File
- NumPy
- List variables
- List the Dimensions
- Let's find out more about temperature.
- What is the sea surface temperature and salinity at 50N, 140W?
- Finding the latitude and longitude indices of 50N, 140W
- Now we have all the information we need to find our answer.
- What is the sea surface temperature and salinity at 50N, 140W?
- Closing your netCDF file

# Geoscience plotting with matplotlib
- Some Examples
- Plotting netCDF data
- Basic Plot
- Let's improve upon the plot into something that is more ready for publication.
- Matplotlib Basemap

## TODO
- Incorporate material from "AMS Short Course on Intermediate Python: Using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib"

## Questions

Do we want to cover more about netcdf. In particular, how to create a netcdf file via netcdf4-python api

## Enthought
enpkg ipython package manager

## TODO

keep it netcf and tds focused
suggest users review basics
pyngl and pynio
talk to phillip at scipy

## Sean

Get your scripts on github
figure out cartopy

## Russ

Talk to Dave Brown
IS it better to use pynio or netcdf4-python

## Longer Term

investigate python-netcdf4 

## Ward

python notebook on the client

## Marcos

Helping Sean with Python with catalog parsing

## Ben

Evaluate workshop material
In particular, getting your environment going and investigating client environments (android, etc.)
